Under the folder duibi are the methods and results of different species trained using the comparative learning model.
Under the mlp folder are the methods and results of model training using the mlp method for different species.
Under the one folder are the methods and results of model training using the RSK method for different species.
Only one species is uploaded above as an example
After the three models are predicted, running vote_2.py will conduct a vote, and the vote_result folder stores the voting results.


The comparison learning method and MLP method are run on ptorch 1.7.1 or above, python==3.8.
The rsk method runs on environment tf1.14, python==2.7


The different species datasets are stored on Google Cloud Drive at the link https://drive.google.com/file/d/13jozR1ou7-SD3vaILZ0PA6bUBr8ATIjk/view?usp=drive_link


The predict tool is deposited at the link https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SI0xcy4Pj1j_84Qlyk1Gt--lByWAYVB6/view?usp=drive_link
